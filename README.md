meeno
=====

A strongly typed, immutable java-8 implementation of the Betfair NG-API for use in non-interactive (aka bot) applications.

This project is functional but is still very much a work in progress... use at your own risk.  Most API calls have been implemented but not all.
If you need help please contact me via github or twitter (https://twitter.com/nickpomfret).

To get started take a look at the 'live' examples: https://github.com/npomfret/meeno/tree/master/test/live.

There is no release as yet, but you can clone the project and run 'ant jar' (assuming you have ant installed).
