=====

A strongly typed, immutable, java 8 implementation of the Betfair NG-API for use in non-interactive (aka bot) applications.

This project is functional but is still very much a work in progress... use at your own risk.  Most API calls have been implemented but not all.
If you need help please contact me via [github](https://github.com/npomfret) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/nickpomfret).

To get started take a look at the [live](https://github.com/npomfret/meeno/tree/master/test/live) examples.

There is no release as yet, but you can clone the project and run:

    gradle jar
