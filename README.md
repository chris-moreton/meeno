meeno
=====

A strongly typed, immutable java-8 implementation of the Betfair NG-API for use in non-interactive (aka bot) applications.

This project is a work in progress... use at your own risk.

To get started take a look at the 'live' examples: https://github.com/npomfret/meeno/tree/master/test/live

There is no release as yet, but you can clone the project and run 'ant jar' (assuming you have ant installed).
